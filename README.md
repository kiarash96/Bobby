# Bobby is going to university

This repository contains source code for my Advanced Programming course final project, a 2d platformer/side scrolling video game written in *Java*.

The name and the idea came from an 80s game titled [Bobby is going home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_is_Going_Home); released for Atari 2600.
